Micro:bit is a microcontroller that was created in 2016 to teach children
programming. It is easier to use than Arduino, and can be programmed with blocks
like Scratch or text-based languages like Python and JavaScript. Micro:bit has
built-in a LED-matrix, buttons, gyroscope, Bluetooth, etc., and
is currently shared free of charge to all 12-year-olds in the UK.
