Right now you read this website with your browser. The text is sent over the
internet from a computer to your computer. But how is all this possible?

The web consists of many building blocks and the web course teaches you about
three of these building blocks; *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. HTML is text
describing the content of a website. CSS is the style, how the website should
look. And JavaScript is a programming language that tells you what your browser
should do. Are these three building blocks correctly combined, you will
get a website!
